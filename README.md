# 🎮 Inspiration & Context
Long trips, cramped seats, and the classic struggle of holding a phone between two people make watching movies while traveling a hassle. Earbuds get shared, arms get tired, and if friends are seated far apart, staying in sync becomes impossible. 

*OnTheGoVR* transforms this messy experience into a private shared cinema you can step into anywhere, entirely offline.

# 🚀 Features
- Offline Shared Cinema: You can start a session, share a simple code, and enjoy perfectly synced playback with friends on the same local network, without the need of internet.  
- 2D and Immersive Modes: You can pick between a traditional flat-screen view or a fully spatial VR theatre.  
- Smart Local Discovery: The app automatically searches for movie files on your device, helping you find what you need quickly.  
- Easy File Upload: At home, you can use OnTheGoVR directly to assist you with uploading your movies to the headset;
- Personalized Environments: Each user can explore their preferred VR space, adjust lighting, and relax independently while still watching together.  
- Synchronized Controls: Whenever one user pauses or plays the movie, changes reflect to the other clients in sync.

# ⚙️ Meta Spatial SDK Integration
The immersive experience is built using the Meta Spatial SDK, combining spatial rendering, scene management, and Kotlin-based interactions to create a comfortable virtual cinema.  
The offline streaming system works by placing all participants on the same Wi-Fi network or hotspot. The host exposes a direct local stream, and clients connect to it to receive synchronized playback without relying on external connectivity.

# 🔨 Timeframe & Tools
- Kotlin  
- Android Studio  
- Meta Spatial SDK  
- Local network streaming architecture  
Created specifically for the Meta Horizon Start Developer Competition. All the scenes are uniquely built for the competitions.
